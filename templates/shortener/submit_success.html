Need to add fields for adding tags to the URL's.
Be sure to set the control containing the pre-selected links
such that you can select multiple links - a multi-select box.

Add two forms: the first form is based on the TagList model,
and the second is based on the URLTags model.  If we post from
the TagList form, we add that tag(s) to the TagList table, and
attach it to the URL.  If we post from the URLTags form, we
simply attach the selected tag(s) to that particular URL.

Tags are comma separated strings that can be up to 64 characters
each.
